# Machine Learning Projects (Basics to Advanced)

This repository contains all the machine learning projects which I build throughout my journey. Some projects are followed along with the tutorials and some are the result of my practise.
This repository contains the code for all my machine learning projects. The topics covered in this repo are:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Trees and Random Forests
4. Support Vector Machines
5. K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
6. Naive Bayesian Classification Algorithm
7. Neural Networks with Keras
8. Convolutional Neural Network using Tensorflow
9. Recurrent Neural Networks
10. Natural Language Processing - Text classification, Sentiment Analysis & Topic Modelling
