# Machine Learning Projects (Basics to Advanced)

This repository contains all the machine learning projects which I build throughout my journey. Some projects are followed along with the tutorial and some are the result of my practise.

## Installation

To run these projects, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

#### You can install these libraries using pip, the Python package manager. Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command:

`pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib`
